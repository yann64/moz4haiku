# moz4haiku
Modest attemps at building Mozilla apps under Haiku

The build4haiku.sh will install pre-requisites, download the source code, and buld the bootstrap eecutables.

Make sure 'build4haiku.sh' has autorization to be executed. Run it from terminal.

For now Mozilla applications cannot been built (yet, WIP).
